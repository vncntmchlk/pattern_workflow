# Introduction to composing with algorithms

## What is composing with algorithms?

- Not setting every detail of a composition manually
- Instead creating a process that makes structures (the algorithm)
- Converting these structures into musical parameters to make sound
- Combining and manipulating the output to make a piece of music

## Examples

- Examples of algorithms I used: Cellular automata, L-Systems (self-similiarity)
- These algorithms can be used directly for sound synthesis
- Or to generate a score, or parts of a score (which is what I am doing mostly)

## Why I compose with algorithms

- Helps to create unique forms and structures
- I can take a curator approach to composition
- It has not been explored much in electronic music (at least compared to visual arts)
- Algorithms can be tweaked in real-time, as they are generating, so they can be part of an electronic instrument in a performance

# The role of SuperCollider in my works

- Playground for testing the musical applications of any algorithm
- Quickly map the algorithmic data to any musical parameter and listen to the results
- Simplicity of combining and manipulating algorithmic output using SC patterns
- Ability to perform live via a self-made instrument or control-interface

Next, we will look at the tutorial for my pattern workflow.

# Hackmeck

- Computermusician trio from Germany, started in 2020
- Composing and performing together, the music generation is split between the three of us
- Each of us focusing on just one aspect of the music changes how we work as composers
- Use of visualizations to show the music generating processes, so it is not a blackbox to the audience
- Using DIY instruments to perform
- Modular way of working makes us dependent on each other
